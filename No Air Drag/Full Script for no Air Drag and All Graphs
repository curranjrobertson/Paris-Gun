%% Constants
v0 = 1640; % initial velocity  (m/s)
theta = 55; % Launch Angle (degrees)
g = 9.81; % acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

%% Solving for time of flight (TOF)
tpeak = (v0*sind(theta))/g;
tflight = 2*tpeak;

%% Solving for Maximum Range in x-direction
xmax = v0*cosd(theta)*tflight; % Maximum distance traveled in the x-direction (m)
xmaxkm = xmax/1000;
step = 0.1; % step size (m)
timevector = 0:step:tflight; % time vector (m)


%% Descritized Vectors for Dynamics

xpositionvector = v0*cosd(theta)*timevector;
ypositionvector = v0*sind(theta)*timevector-0.5*g*(timevector.^2);

xvelocityvector = v0*cosd(theta)+0*timevector;
yvelocityvector = v0*sind(theta)-g*timevector;
